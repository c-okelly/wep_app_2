                                    <p>Where did it all start?</p>
                                 <div class="text_img_blog"><a href="http://www.350south.org/"><img class="blog_text_wraped" src="../images/Blogs/Blog%201.jpg" alt="Image from blog"></a></div><p>In January 2010, after finishing 5 years of study in University College Dublin, Ian Lacey moved to Denver, Colorado, USA to work for the environmental non-profit organisation, The Wilderness Society. It was there that he was recommended a book by Swedish adventurer Goran Kropp – a man who cycled from Stockholm to Mt. Everest in Nepal, climbed it without the aid of bottled oxygen, came back down and cycled home again. After such a brave and raw adventure, Ian just knew he had to take on a similar human powered journey.  And within minutes, after looking at the National Geographic map on his bedroom wall, it seemed that cycling down the Americas could be a pretty nice way to spend a year. Ian had recently met Lee, a friend who worked in a coffee shop during the week and went rock climbing and snowboarding in the Rocky Mountains on the weekends. After chatting about the idea, they both realised it was high time they did something that matched their adventurous spirits. There and then, they decided to cycle the length of the Americas in 350 days.

Cycling Silk was a 10-month, 10-country, 10,000-kilometer biking expedition along the Silk Road between Europe and Asia. Our goal was to explore borderland wildernesses along the way, using bikes as vehicles for adventure, research, and environmental advocacy.</p>

<p>Mission Statement</p>
<p>1) To investigate with borderless minds and hearts the pros and cons, successes and shortcomings, complexities and challenges of transboundary wilderness conservation in the mountains and deserts of the Silk Road.</p>

<p>2) To explore the actual and potential impact of transboundary protected areas (TBPAs) on landscapes, communities, and the geopolitics of regional peace.</p>

<p>3) To share our explorations through writing, photography, and video, and raise broad awareness about transboundary conservation.</p>

<p>4) To help others fall in love with the wildest places along the Silk Road, through all of the above, since making people care about a place is usually a prerequisite for its conservation.</p>

<p>Methodology</p>

<p>Diligent pre-expedition research, preparation, and training. Interviews with transboundary conservation stakeholders on local, regional, national, and international levels to glean and portray diverse perspectives on conservation across borders on the Silk Road. On-the-ground exploration and documentation of landscapes and communities in borderlands. Bicycles for self-propelled transportation to transboundary wildernesses located between Turkey and India. And when all carefully plotted plans and strategies failed us, brute improvisation.

                                 <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/"><img class="blog_text_wraped" src="../images/Blogs/blog%203.jpg" alt="Bolg page image"></a></div>
                                 
                                <p class="bold_lined">About Me</p>
<p>I’m Tom from England. That’s me on my most recent journey: the length of England without any money (no cash, no cards, and a bike I rescued from a scrapyard).</p>

<p>Since 2006 I’ve been going on bicycle adventures to places like Sudan, Iran, Yemen, Syria, the Arctic, Ethiopia, Armenia and Mongolia. There’s about 40 countries on the list, but numbers are boring.</p>

<p>A love of adventure is what drives my journeys, and a love of writing is what drives this blog. I share stories, ideas, news and knowledge on the subject of modern-day bicycle travel. So if you’re just dipping a toe into the world of adventure cycling, or you’re planning a big trip and are looking for a voice of experience to help out, you’re probably in the right place.</p>

<p class="bold_lined">Why adventure cycling?</p>

<p>I guess it started when my parents took the stabilisers off my first bike and I disappeared across the village green, aged 4. Cue much fretting and wailing from aforementioned parents.</p>

<p>Aged 6, I completed my first long-distance cycle tour: a lap of Rutland Water, all 17 miles of it.</p>

<p>As an older child, one of my ambitions was to ride my BMX off a ramp into the River Welland. (I built a ramp, but wasn’t quite brave enough to take the leap.)</p>

<p>At university I got fat and lazy and spent much of my final year trying to burn off the beer and cheesy chips by throwing myself down the hillsides of Exmoor on a mountain-bike.</p>

<p>Then I went to Scotland and spent a week lugging my bike and gear through rainy off-road trails in the West Highlands. Thoroughly miserable, the most fun I’ve ever had on a bike, and the trip that sowed the seeds.</p>

<p>The logical progression from there seemed to be to try and ride as far as possible and see what happened. In late 2006 I began planning a long trip called “Ride Earth” — a journey around the world by bicycle. (This is where the story gets more interesting. I set off, but have never really finished.)</p>

<p class="bold_lined">Now?</p>
<p>Sleeping under the Saharan stars</p>
                                 <p>
I’ve travelled to over 40 countries on 4 continents on my bicycle since then. I’ve been spending months at a time on the road, setting up home wherever I see fit, and meeting hundreds of other cycle travellers in the process. Rather than a quick lap of the planet and a pat on the back, this somehow became my full-time occupation; I have no fixed abode, although I have bases of sorts in England and Armenia.</p>

<p>My blog today, as well as continuing to recount tales of adventure, is largely about exploring the broad potential of bicycle travel as a tool for making personal, meaningful journeys, and sharing what I discover in the hope of making bicycle travel accessible to all who dream of it.</p>

<p>If you’re just such a dreamer, if you’re midway through planning a journey, or even if you’re a seasoned veteran of life on the road, there’s something here for you.
