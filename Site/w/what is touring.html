                            <p> Bicycle touring means self-contained cycling trips for pleasure, adventure and
                                autonomy rather than sport, commuting or exercise. Touring can range from single
                                to multi-day trips, even years. Tours may be planned by the participant or
                                organised by a holiday business, a club, or a charity as a fund-raising 
                                venture.</p>

                            <p class="bold_lined center">Its Origins</p>
                            <p>Historian James McGurn speaks of bets being taken in London in the 19th century for riders of hobby-horses – machines pushed by the feet rather than pedaled – outspeeding stagecoaches. "One practitioner beat a four-horse coach to Brighton by half an hour," he says. "There are various accounts of 15 to 17-year-olds draisienne-touring around France in the 1820s. On 17 February 1869 John Mayall, Charles Spencer and Rowley Turner rode from Trafalgar Square, London, to Brighton in 15 hours for 53 miles. The Times, which had sent a reporter to follow them in a coach and pair, reported an "Extraordinary Velocipede Feat." Three riders set off from Liverpool to London, a journey of three days and so more akin to modern cycle-touring, in March that same year. A newspaper report said:<br><br>

Their bicycles caused no little astonishment on the way, and the remarks passed by the natives were almost amusing. At some of the villages the boys clustered round the machines, and, where they could, caught hold of them and ran behind until they were tired out. Many enquiries were made as to the name of 'them queer horses', some called them 'whirligigs', 'menageries' and 'valparaisons'. Between Wolverhampton and Birmingham, attempts were made to upset the riders by throwing stones. <br><br></p>
                                <div class="text_img_wit">
                                <img class="what_tour_text_wraped" src="../images/what_touring/Origins_touring.jpg" alt="Historical bicycle being ridden"></div>
                        
<p>
Enthusiasm extended to other countries. The New York Times spoke of "quantities of velocipedes flying like shuttles hither and thither". But while British interest had less frenzy than in the USA, it lasted longer.<br><br>

The expansion from a machine that had to be pushed, or propelled through pedals on a small front wheel, made longer distances feasible. A rider calling himself "A Light Dragoon" told in 1870 or 1871 of a ride from Lewes to Salisbury, across southern England. The title of his book, Wheels and Woes, suggests a less than event-free ride but McGurn says "it seems to have been a delightful adventure, despite bad road surfaces, dust and lack of signposts.<br><br>

Journeys grew more adventurous. Thomas Stevens, a writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, set off around the world April 22, 1884 on a 50-inch Columbia with a money belt, a revolver, two shirts and a rain cape, spending two years on the road and writing articles which became a two-volume 1,021-page book. John Foster Fraser and two friends set off round the world on safety bicycles in July 1896. He, Edward Lunn and F. H. Lowe rode 19,237 miles, through 17 countries, in two years and two months. By 1878, recreational cycling was enough established in Britain to lead to formation of the Bicycle Touring Club, later renamed Cyclists' Touring Club. It is the oldest national tourism organisation in the world. Members, like those of other clubs, often rode in uniform. The CTC appointed an official tailor. The uniform was a dark green Devonshire serge jacket, knickerbockers and a "Stanley helmet with a small peak". The colour changed to grey when green proved impractical because it showed the dirt. Groups often rode with a bugler at their head to sound changes of direction or to bring the group to a halt. Confusion could be caused when groups met and mistook each other's signals.<br><br>

Membership of the CTC inspired the Frenchman, Paul de Vivie (b. April 29, 1853), to found what became the Fédération Française de Cyclotourisme, the world's largest cycling association, and to coin the French word cyclo-tourisme. The League of American Wheelmen in the USA was founded in Newport, Rhode Island on May 30, 1880. It shared an interest in leisure cycling with the administration of cycle racing. Membership peaked at 103,000 in 1898. The national cycle-touring organization in the USA is now the Adventure Cycling Association (ACA). The ACA, then called Bikecentennial, organised a mass ride in 1976 from one side of the USA to the other to mark the nation's 200th anniversary. The Bikecentennial route is still in use as the TransAmerica Trail.</p>

                            <p>Distances vary considerably. Depending on fitness, speed and the number of stops, the rider usually covers between 50–150 kilometres (30–90 mi) per day. A short tour over a few days may cover as little as 200 kilometres (120 mi) and a long tour may go right across a country or around the world.</p>

                            <p class="bold_lined center">Lightweight touring</p>
                            <p>Informally called credit-card touring, a rider carries a minimum of equipment and a 
                                lot of money. Overnight accommodation is in youth hostels, hotels, pensions or 
                                B and B. Food is bought at cafes, restaurants or markets.</p>
                                
                            <p class="bold_lined center">Ultralight touring</p>
                            <p>Differs from credit card touring in that the rider is self-sufficient but 
                                carries only the bare essentials and no frills.</p>
                        
                        <p class="bold_lined center">Fully loaded touring</p>
                        <p>Also known as self-supported touring, cyclists carry everything they need, including 
                            food, cooking equipment, and a tent for camping. Some cyclists minimize their 
                            load, carrying only basic supplies,food, and a Bivouac sack or lightweight tent.</p>
                            
                        <p class="bold_lined center">Expedition touring</p>
                        <p>Cyclists travel extensively, often through developing nations or remote areas. The 
                        bicycle is loaded with food, spares, tools, and camping equipment so 
                        that the traveller is largely self-supporting.</p>

                            <p>Thomas Stevens (born 24 December 1854, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England, died London,
                                24 January 1935, aged 80) was the first person to circle the globe by bicycle.
                                He rode a large-wheeled Ordinary, also known as a penny-farthing, from April 1884 
                                to December 1886. He later searched for Henry Morton Stanley in Africa, 
                                investigated the claims of Indian ascetics and became manager of the 
                                Garrick Theatre in London.</p>
                            <p>Stevens, known as Tom, was born in Castle Street, Berkhamsted, the son of William and Ann Stevens. His father was a labourer. Thomas had an older sister, Bridget, and younger, Jane. He went to Bourne Charity School, then became an apprentice grocer. His father emigrated to Missouri in 1868 but returned when his wife became ill and before the rest of the family could also go to America. Tom went with a half-brother but without his parents and sisters in 1871 and the rest of the family followed two years later. They moved to Denver and then to San Francisco, where he learned to ride a bicycle<br><br>

Adventure Cyclist described him as "a man of medium height, wearing an oversized blue flannel shirt over blue overalls, which were tucked into a pair of leggings at the knee [and] tanned ' as a nut.'A mustache protruded from his face." It said: "A two-year stint in a Wyoming railroad mill ended when he was run out of town after it became known that he was importing British labourers in exchange for part of their salaries. He later found work in a Colorado mine where he came up with the idea of riding a bicycle across the country.</p>
